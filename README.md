# Maze Escape of Reinforcement Learning Agent

---

This program generates random maze using user's option.

The Simulation is based on pygame.

static maze generation would be uploaded. (maybe)

<center>Example Figure. [5X5 Maze] / # of Wall=20 / Sarsa Agent / Episode: 20</center>



## 1. Dependencies

```
python == 3.8.5

pygame == 2.0.1

pillow == 8.1.0

matplotlib == 3.3.2

numpy == 1.19.2

argparse
```

- Editor: PyCharm



## 2. Quick Start

### Window User

- Run "normal.bat", "grad.bat", "sarsa.bat", "q.bat" on terminal.
- Check ./archive result files.



### Linux User

- Make .sh files with the same contents as .bat.
- Do the same as Window User instruction.



those ".bat" files are tutorial. try your own settings! check out "option.py"

## 3. Ablation

#### 5X5 Maze, # of Wall = 20, Episode: 20

#### 5X5 Maze, # of Wall = 20, Episode: 100

Personally, The difficulty of learning : Q >= Sarsa >>> Policy Gradient



## 4. Update

Coming Soon.
